# My Food Lab!

I'm glad to announce that I have completed my first ruby project which is a web application called "MY FOOD LAB". The web application gives information related various Indian food along with user login facility to store recipes to fav lists.
India's top chef Mr.Sanjyot Keer has a Youtube channel but doesn't have a website. That's the reason I decided this topic for the project. I know this web application is not perfect, I just started small so I could convert it to actual website for chef SK.


## The project's aim
* To create a system with at least 3 associated models
* Handles invalid data
* Use a GEM that talks to an API to add functionality
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Make sure you have basic authentication and authorisation set up
* To learn how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors
* Deploy code to Heroku

## Technologies
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML
* CSS

## Gem
* Cloudinary gem is used in this project to upload users' images to the web
* Bootstrap v4.6 is used as a framework to style the project's front end
* The app uses bcrypt gem to store the users' password that ensure the security


## App development approach
* To keep things simple (KISS) and meet basic requirements
* Efficient working with back end as well as front end development
