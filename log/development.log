NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Once the oil is hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves and saute for few seconds. Then add the the onion, garlic, ginger and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until the onion is translucent. Add the tomatoes and cashews and mix. Then add 1 cup of water. Cover the pan and cook on medium heat for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the pan from heat. Remove the bay leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves. Let the mixture cool down a bit and then transfer to a blender. It’s important to let it cool down a bit else it will all blow up from the mixer. Grind the masala to a smooth paste and set aside. To the same pan now add 2 tablespoons butter along with remaining 1 teaspoon oil on medium heat.  Once the butter melts, add the red chili powder and the Kashmiri red chili powder and fry for few seconds. This will give the curry a nice orange-red color. Then add the ground paste back into the pan along with the garam masala (start with 1/2 teaspoon and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon at the end only if you feel like the curry needs that extra bit of garam masala), cardamom powder, sugar, salt and tomato paste (if using). Mix well and cook for 1-2 minutes. Then add the cream and mix. Add in the paneer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat. Finally add crushed kasuri methi.  Garnish paneer butter masala with cilantro and serve hot with naan or rice!", "video"=>"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbGVg2j0xc4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}, "commit"=>"Edit Recipe", "id"=>"87"}

Place a frying pan over a medium-high heat and scatter in the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat. Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or whiz to a powder in a food processor. Once ground, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredient and ½ teaspoon of sea salt, then whiz to a smooth paste. Put aside. Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips. On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden. Add the chicken and 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and black pepper, add the tomatoes, breaking them up with the back of a spoon, and the coconut milk, then bring to the boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then remove the lid and cook for a further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally. Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Add a dollop of yoghurt and a wedge of lemon to each bowl.

To prepare this easy recipe, firstly, clean and wash the mutton pieces. Next, put a large pan over medium flame and melt ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon stick. Saute these for a minute and add the sliced onions along with salt in it. Saute till the onion turns light brown in colour. Next, add the ginger paste along with garlic paste and cook the mixture until the raw smell disappears.  Step 2 Add the powdered spices, tomatoes & mutton pieces Now, add turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder to the fried onion and mix it well. Add the mashed tomatoes and mix it well with the other ingredients. Make sure the tomatoes turn pulpy and cook this mix until oil separates from the masala in the pan. Now, add mutton pieces in this masala and mix it well. Ensure that mutton pieces are evenly coated with the masala.  Step 3 Add the yoghurt, coriander leaves & garam masala Pour the yoghurt in the mutton masala and mix it well. Let it cook for 4-5 minutes and, then, add water in it. Stir it well and check the seasoning once. Then, add chopped coriander leaves along with garam masala powder. Give it a quick stir. Cook it for another 25 minutes to ensure that mutton is no longer raw and is perfectly juicy. Once done, take it off the flame and transfer the dish in a bowl.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (MyfoodsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (MyfoodsController#show is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Step 2: Next roll out the dough. Cut it into rounds and place them on a damp cloth covered with another damp cloth. Traditionally the dough is divided into small marble-sized balls, and each ball is rolled out individually. Some people use a roti maker to flatten out individual balls. Basically, they use this appliance as a pani puri maker. If you have it, go ahead and use it, it does flatten out the dough evenly, which will help in the puris puffing us evenly. But it is not a necessity and a must-have. Do it as I did, and you will have good results as well. Seriously, no biggie! Step 3: Next, fry the puri in moderately hot oil until golden brown.

Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.
